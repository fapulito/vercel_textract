# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing OCR SaaS application by adding LLM-powered document analysis using Amazon Bedrock with Claude. Instead of just extracting raw text, the system will provide intelligent analysis, structured data extraction, and insights from documents. This positions the application as an AI Agent for the AWS AI Agent Global Hackathon, demonstrating autonomous reasoning and complex task execution.

## Glossary

- **OCR System**: The existing AWS Textract-based text extraction system
- **LLM Analyzer**: Amazon Bedrock service using Claude models for document intelligence
- **Analysis Job**: A processing task that combines OCR extraction with LLM-powered analysis
- **Document History**: A persistent record of user's processed documents and analysis results
- **Enterprise Tier**: A new pricing tier above Pro for high-volume business users
- **Structured Output**: JSON-formatted analysis results with categorized insights

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

4. THE LLM Analyzer SHALL identify important clauses, dates, and parties for contract documents
5. THE LLM Analyzer SHALL structure form data into labeled fields with extracted values

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my document processing history, so that I can access previous analyses without re-uploading documents

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE OCR System SHALL store metadata for each processed document including filename, upload date, and analysis type
2. THE OCR System SHALL provide a history page displaying the user's last 50 processed documents
3. WHEN a user clicks a history entry, THE OCR System SHALL display the original results without reprocessing
4. THE OCR System SHALL allow users to download previous results in CSV or JSON format
5. THE OCR System SHALL retain history records for 90 days for Free tier and 365 days for paid tiers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a free tier user, I want to try LLM analysis with limited usage, so that I can evaluate the feature before upgrading

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE OCR System SHALL allow Free tier users 2 LLM analyses per month
2. THE OCR System SHALL allow Pro tier users 50 LLM analyses per month
3. THE OCR System SHALL display remaining LLM analysis quota on the upload page
4. WHEN a user exceeds their quota, THE OCR System SHALL display an upgrade prompt with tier comparison
5. THE OCR System SHALL reset usage counters on the first day of each calendar month

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business user, I want an Enterprise tier with higher limits, so that I can process large volumes of documents for my organization

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE OCR System SHALL offer an Enterprise tier with 1000 documents per month and 500 LLM analyses
2. THE Enterprise Tier SHALL support documents up to 100 pages and 50MB file size
3. THE OCR System SHALL price the Enterprise tier at $99 per month
4. THE Enterprise Tier SHALL retain document history for 730 days
5. THE OCR System SHALL provide API access for Enterprise tier users

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate the service via API, so that I can automate document processing in my applications

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE a user has Enterprise tier access, THE OCR System SHALL provide API key generation functionality
2. THE OCR System SHALL expose REST endpoints for document upload, status checking, and result retrieval
3. THE OCR System SHALL authenticate API requests using bearer token authentication
4. THE OCR System SHALL return structured JSON responses with HTTP status codes following REST conventions
5. THE OCR System SHALL rate limit API requests to 100 requests per hour per API key

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor AWS service costs, so that I can ensure the pricing tiers remain profitable

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE OCR System SHALL log AWS Textract and Bedrock API costs for each processing job
2. THE OCR System SHALL calculate per-document processing costs including storage, OCR, and LLM inference
3. THE OCR System SHALL maintain cost metrics in the database for reporting purposes
4. THE OCR System SHALL ensure Free tier costs remain under $0.50 per user per month
5. THE OCR System SHALL ensure paid tier margins exceed 60 percent after AWS service costs
